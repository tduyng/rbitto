# Build your own BitTorrent

[![progress-banner](https://backend.codecrafters.io/progress/bittorrent/4e48431c-7bb5-4da2-95ae-b0cfd40a7799)](https://app.codecrafters.io/users/codecrafters-bot?r=2qF)

Welcome to the "Build Your Own DNS Server" Challenge repository for Rust solutions!

## Overview

This repository serves as a my Rust solutions to the
["Build Your Own BitTorrent" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/bittorrent/overview).

You’ll build a BitTorrent client that's capable of parsing a
.torrent file and downloading a file from a peer. Along the way, we’ll learn
about how torrent files are structured, HTTP trackers, BitTorrent’s Peer
Protocol, pipelining and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.


# Getting started

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.70)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_bittorrent.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main.rs`. This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be slow
   the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
